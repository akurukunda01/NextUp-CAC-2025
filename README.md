# NextUp 
### A Civic Engagement Platform for the Next Generation

## Overview
**NextUp** is an app designed to encourage young people to get involved in their communities. It helps users share opinions, participate in polls, and stay informed about local events.  

The app has three main features:  
1. **Representative Suggestion Box** – Users can submit questions or opinions directly to their representatives. Administrators can view these messages to understand youth perspectives on community issues.  
2. **Mock Polls** – Users can vote in polls created by administrators. Results help leaders understand youth opinions while giving students another way to be heard.  
3. **Community Calendar** – Administrators can post events like town halls so users can stay informed and engaged.
